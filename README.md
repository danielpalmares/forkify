# Forkify :yellow_heart:
Forkify is where you can search for a bunch of recipes which are coming from this API: [forkify API V2](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2).

I've used in this application:
* **MVC** architecture 
* Parcel bundler
* Sass
* And a lot of new JS features...

I should say that developing this complex app at the current moment was a lot of fun, and I'm looking foward to make some new cool stuff like that or even better soon! :smile:
